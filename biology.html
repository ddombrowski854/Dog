	        <h2>Anatomy</h2>
		        <p>Domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Modern dog breeds show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal.</p>

	        <h2>Size and Weight</h2>
		        <p>Dogs are highly variable in height and weight. The smallest known adult dog was a <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_Terrier">Yorkshire Terrier</a> that stood only 6.3 <abbr title="centimetres">cm</abbr> (2+1⁄2 inches) at the shoulder, 9.5 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr> (3+3⁄4 in) in length along the head-and-body and weighed only 113 grams (4 <abbr title="ounces">oz.</abbr>). The heaviest dog was an English Mastiff named Zorba which weighed 314 pounds (142 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr>). The tallest known adult dog is a Great Dane, which stands 106.7 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr> (42.0 <abbr title-"inches">in</abbr>) at the shoulder.</p>

	        <h2>Coat</h2>	
		        <p>The <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur">coats</a> of domestic dogs are of two varieties: "<i>double</i>" being familiar with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or "<i>single</i>," with the topcoat only. Breeds may have an occasional "<i>blaze</i>,"<i>stripe</i>", or "<i>star</i>" of white fur on their chest or underside. Premature graying can occur in dogs from as early as one year of age; this is associated with impulsive behaviors, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety">anxiety behaviors</a>, fear of noise, and fear of unfamiliar people or animals.</p>

	        <h2>Tail</h2>
		        <p>There are many different shapes for <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_anatomy#Tail">dog tails</a>: straight, straight up, sickle, curled, or corkscrew. As with many canids, one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state, which can be crucial in getting along with others. In some hunting dogs, however, the tail is traditionally <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(dog)">docked</a> to avoid injuries.</p>
