        <h1>Evolution of Dogs</h1>
		<p>The <i>Cretaceous–Paleogene</i> extinction event occurred <time>65 million years</time> ago and brought an end to the dinosaurs and the appearance of the first <i>carnivorans</i>. The name <i>carnivoran</i> is given to a member of the order <i class="taxonomy">Carnivora</i>. <i class="taxonomy">Carnivorans</i> possess a common arrangement of teeth called <img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog#/media/File:Brechschere-Hund.jpg"alt="">carnassials</img>, in which the first lower molar and the last upper premolar possess blade-like enamel <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(tooth)">crowns</a> that act similar to a pair of shears for cutting meat. This dental arrangement has been modified by adaptation over the past <time>60 million years</time> for diets composed of meat, for crushing vegetation, or for the loss of the carnassial function altogether as in seals, sea lions, and walruses. Today, not all carnivorans are <em>carnivores</em>, such as the insect-eating <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aardwolf">Aardwolf</a>.</p>
		<p>The carnivoran ancestors of the dog-like <i>caniforms</i> and the cat-like <i>feliforms</i> began their separate evolutionary paths just after the end of the dinosaurs. The <em>first</em> members of the dog family <i class="taxonomy">Canidae</i> appeared <time>40 million years</time> ago, of which only its subfamily the <i>Caninae</i> survives today in the form of the <strong>wolf-like</strong> and <strong>fox-like</strong> canines. Within the Caninae, the first members of <i class="taxonomy">genus Canis</i> appeared <time>6 million years</time> ago, the ancestors of modern domestic dogs, wolves, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coyote">coyotes</a>, and golden jackals.</p>

	<h2><strong>Domestication</strong></h2>
		<p>The generally accepted earliest dog remains were discovered in <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberkassel,_Bonn">Bonn-Oberkassel, Germany</a>. Contextual, isotopic, genetic, and morphological evidence shows that this dog was <em>not</em> a local wolf. The dog was dated to <time>14,223 years</time> ago and was found buried along with a man and a woman, all three having been sprayed with <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematite">red hematite powder</a> and buried under large, thick basalt blocks. The dog had died of <!--footpad disease-->canine distemper. Earlier remains dating back to <time>30,000 years</time> ago have been described as <i class="taxonomy">Paleolithic</i> dogs but their status as dogs or wolves remains debated because considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves during the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Pleistocene">Late Pleistocene</a>.</p>
		<p>This timing indicates that the dog was the <em>first</em> species to be domesticated in the time of hunter–gatherers, which predates agriculture. <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid">DNA</abbr> sequences show that all ancient and modern dogs share a common ancestry and descended from an ancient, extinct wolf population which was distinct from the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf">modern wolf</a> lineage. Most dogs form a sister group to the remains of a <i class="taxonomy">Late Pleistocene</i> wolf found in the Kessleroch cave near Thayngen in the canton of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schaffhausen">Schaffhausen, Switzerland</a>, which dates to <time>14,500 years</time> ago. The most recent common ancestor of both is estimated to be from <time>32,100 years</time> ago. This indicates that an extinct <i>Late Pleistocene</i> wolf may have been the ancestor of the dog, with the modern wolf being the dog's nearest living relative.</p>
		<p>The dog is a classic example of a domestic animal that likely travelled a commensal pathway into domestication. The questions of when and where dogs were first domesticated have taxed geneticists and archaeologists for decades. Genetic studies suggest a domestication process commencing over <time>25,000 years</time> ago, in one or several wolf populations in either Europe, the high Arctic, or eastern Asia. In 2021, a literature review of the current evidence infers that the dog was domesticated in <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia">Siberia</a> <time>23,000 years</time> ago by ancient North Siberians, then later dispersed eastward into the Americas and westward across Eurasia.</p>
