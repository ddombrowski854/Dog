	<h1>Dog</h1>
	<body>	
		<p>The domestic dog, <i>Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris</i>, is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. The dog derived from an ancient, <i>extinct wolf</i>, with the modern grey wolf being the dog's nearest living relative. The dog was the <em>first</em> species to be domesticated by hunter–gatherers over <time>15,000 years</time> ago, before the development of agriculture. Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely adapted to human behavior, leading to a large number of domestic individuals and the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canidae">canids</a>.</p>
		<p>The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dogs are sub classified into <em>breeds</em>, which vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting_dog">hunting</a>, herding, pulling loads, protection, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog">assisting police</a> and the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogs_in_warfare">military</a>, companionship, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy_dog">therapy</a>, and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistance_dog">aiding disabled people</a>. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of <i>man's best friend.</i></p>

	<h2>Evolution</h2>
		<p>The <i>Cretaceous–Paleogene</i> extinction event occurred <time>65 million years</time> ago and brought an end to the dinosaurs and the appearance of the first <i>carnivorans</i>. The name <i>carnivoran</i> is given to a member of the order <i class="taxonomy">Carnivora</i>. <i class="taxonomy">Carnivorans</i> possess a common arrangement of teeth called <img src="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog#/media/File:Brechschere-Hund.jpg"alt="">carnassials</img>, in which the first lower molar and the last upper premolar possess blade-like enamel <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(tooth)">crowns</a> that act similar to a pair of shears for cutting meat. This dental arrangement has been modified by adaptation over the past <time>60 million years</time> for diets composed of meat, for crushing vegetation, or for the loss of the carnassial function altogether as in seals, sea lions, and walruses. Today, not all carnivorans are <em>carnivores</em>, such as the insect-eating <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aardwolf">Aardwolf</a>.</p>
		<p>The carnivoran ancestors of the dog-like <i>caniforms</i> and the cat-like <i>feliforms</i> began their separate evolutionary paths just after the end of the dinosaurs. The <em>first</em> members of the dog family <i class="taxonomy">Canidae</i> appeared <time>40 million years</time> ago, of which only its subfamily the <i>Caninae</i> survives today in the form of the <strong>wolf-like</strong> and <strong>fox-like</strong> canines. Within the Caninae, the first members of <i class="taxonomy">genus Canis</i> appeared <time>6 million years</time> ago, the ancestors of modern domestic dogs, wolves, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coyote">coyotes</a>, and golden jackals.</p>
	<h3><strong>Domestication</strong></h3>
		<p>The generally accepted earliest dog remains were discovered in <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberkassel,_Bonn">Bonn-Oberkassel, Germany</a>. Contextual, isotopic, genetic, and morphological evidence shows that this dog was <em>not</em> a local wolf. The dog was dated to <time>14,223 years</time> ago and was found buried along with a man and a woman, all three having been sprayed with <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematite">red hematite powder</a> and buried under large, thick basalt blocks. The dog had died of <!--footpad disease-->canine distemper. Earlier remains dating back to <time>30,000 years</time> ago have been described as <i class="taxonomy">Paleolithic</i> dogs but their status as dogs or wolves remains debated because considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves during the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Pleistocene">Late Pleistocene</a>.</p>
		<p>This timing indicates that the dog was the <em>first</em> species to be domesticated in the time of hunter–gatherers, which predates agriculture. <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid">DNA</abbr> sequences show that all ancient and modern dogs share a common ancestry and descended from an ancient, extinct wolf population which was distinct from the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf">modern wolf</a> lineage. Most dogs form a sister group to the remains of a <i class="taxonomy">Late Pleistocene</i> wolf found in the Kessleroch cave near Thayngen in the canton of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schaffhausen">Schaffhausen, Switzerland</a>, which dates to <time>14,500 years</time> ago. The most recent common ancestor of both is estimated to be from <time>32,100 years</time> ago. This indicates that an extinct <i>Late Pleistocene</i> wolf may have been the ancestor of the dog, with the modern wolf being the dog's nearest living relative.</p>
		<p>The dog is a classic example of a domestic animal that likely travelled a commensal pathway into domestication. The questions of when and where dogs were first domesticated have taxed geneticists and archaeologists for decades. Genetic studies suggest a domestication process commencing over <time>25,000 years</time> ago, in one or several wolf populations in either Europe, the high Arctic, or eastern Asia. In 2021, a literature review of the current evidence infers that the dog was domesticated in <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia">Siberia</a> <time>23,000 years</time> ago by ancient North Siberians, then later dispersed eastward into the Americas and westward across Eurasia.</p>
	<h2>Biology</h2>
	<h3>Anatomy</h3>
		<p>Domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Modern dog breeds show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal.</p>
	<h3>Size and Weight</h3>
		<p>Dogs are highly variable in height and weight. The smallest known adult dog was a <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_Terrier">Yorkshire Terrier</a> that stood only 6.3 <abbr title="centimetres">cm</abbr> (2+1⁄2 inches) at the shoulder, 9.5 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr> (3+3⁄4 in) in length along the head-and-body and weighed only 113 grams (4 <abbr title="ounces">oz.</abbr>). The heaviest dog was an English Mastiff named Zorba which weighed 314 pounds (142 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr>). The tallest known adult dog is a Great Dane, which stands 106.7 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr> (42.0 <abbr title-"inches">in</abbr>) at the shoulder.</p>
	<h3>Senses</h3>
		<p>A dog's senses include vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and sensitivity to Earth's magnetic field. Another study has suggested that dogs can see Earth's magnetic field.</p>
	<h3>Coat</h3>	
		<p>The <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur">coats</a> of domestic dogs are of two varieties: "<i>double</i>" being familiar with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or "<i>single</i>," with the topcoat only. Breeds may have an occasional "<i>blaze</i>,"<i>stripe</i>", or "<i>star</i>" of white fur on their chest or underside. Premature graying can occur in dogs from as early as one year of age; this is associated with impulsive behaviors, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety">anxiety behaviors</a>, fear of noise, and fear of unfamiliar people or animals.</p>
	<h3>Tail</h3>
		<p>There are many different shapes for <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_anatomy#Tail">dog tails</a>: straight, straight up, sickle, curled, or corkscrew. As with many canids, one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state, which can be crucial in getting along with others. In some hunting dogs, however, the tail is traditionally <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(dog)">docked</a> to avoid injuries.</p>
