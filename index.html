		<p>The domestic dog, <i>Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris</i>, is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. The dog derived from an ancient, <i>extinct wolf</i>, with the modern grey wolf being the dog's nearest living relative. The dog was the <em>first</em> species to be domesticated by hunterâ€“gatherers over <time>15,000 years</time> ago, before the development of agriculture. Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely adapted to human behavior, leading to a large number of domestic individuals and the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canidae">canids</a>.</p>

		<p>The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dogs are sub classified into <em>breeds</em>, which vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting_dog">hunting</a>, herding, pulling loads, protection, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog">assisting police</a> and the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogs_in_warfare">military</a>, companionship, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy_dog">therapy</a>, and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistance_dog">aiding disabled people</a>. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of <i>man's best friend.</i></p>
